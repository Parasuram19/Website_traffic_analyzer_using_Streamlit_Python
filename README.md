# Website Traffic Analyzer using Streamlit and Python

This project provides a Streamlit-based web application for analyzing website traffic data.  It allows you to visualize and gain insights into your website's performance using various metrics and charts.

## Overview

The application uses Streamlit, a Python library for creating interactive web apps, to provide a user-friendly interface for exploring website traffic data.  It typically ingests data from a source like Google Analytics, a CSV file, or a database.  Once the data is loaded, the app offers various visualizations and analysis options, such as:

* **Time Series Charts:** Visualizing traffic trends over time (daily, weekly, monthly).
* **Geographic Analysis:** Mapping traffic sources by location.
* **Traffic Source Breakdown:** Identifying the sources of website traffic (e.g., organic search, direct, referrals, social media).
* **Device Breakdown:** Analyzing traffic by device type (desktop, mobile, tablet).
* **Pageviews and Unique Visitors:** Tracking key metrics like pageviews and unique visitors.
* **Customizable Date Ranges:** Selecting specific date ranges for analysis.
* **Data Filtering:** Filtering data based on various criteria.

## Features

* **Interactive Charts:**  Users can interact with the charts (e.g., zoom, pan, hover for details).
* **Data Loading:**  Support for loading data from different sources (CSV, Google Analytics, etc.).  *(Specify the actual data sources supported)*
* **Customizable Analysis:**  Options for customizing the analysis (e.g., choosing metrics, date ranges).
* **User-Friendly Interface:**  Intuitive and easy-to-use web interface.
* **Clear Visualizations:**  Clear and informative charts and graphs.

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

Before running the application, make sure you have the following installed:

* **Python 3.x:**  Ensure you have a compatible Python version installed.
* **Streamlit:** Install Streamlit using pip:
   ```bash
   pip install streamlit
Pandas: For data manipulation:
Bash

pip install pandas
Other Libraries: Install any other required libraries (e.g., matplotlib, plotly, requests for Google Analytics integration). List them here explicitly. For example:
Bash

pip install matplotlib plotly requests
Data Source: Set up your data source (CSV file, Google Analytics account, etc.). If using Google Analytics, you'll likely need to set up API credentials.
Installation
Clone the Repository:

Bash

git clone [https://github.com/Parasuram19/Website_traffic_analyzer_using_Streamlit_Python.git](https://www.google.com/search?q=https://github.com/Parasuram19/Website_traffic_analyzer_using_Streamlit_Python.git)
Navigate to the Directory:

Bash

cd Website_traffic_analyzer_using_Streamlit_Python
Install Dependencies: (If you haven't already)

Bash

pip install -r requirements.txt  # If you have a requirements.txt file
# OR install individually as shown above
Running the Application
Run the Streamlit app:

Bash

streamlit run app.py  # Replace app.py with the actual name of your main script
Open in Browser:  Streamlit will provide a URL in the terminal. Open this URL in your web browser to access the application.
